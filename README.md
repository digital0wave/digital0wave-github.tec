# Pelter Controller

This is the firmware for a pelter controller. The RTOS was designed from scratch in C++, as well as all of the drivers, The system in question mirrors a real-world application: temperature stabilization and bias control for a semiconductor laser.

The lab hardware includes: 
• A power resistor (to simulate the laser’s waste heat) 
• A thermoelectric cooler module • A temperature sensor 
• A microprocessor controller(68HC12).
